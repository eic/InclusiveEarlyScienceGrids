\section{Analysis Code}

The analysis of the simulation output is conducted using standard ROOT/C++ macros, with a separate macro for each beam and binning setting. The code is stored in a GitHub repository that can be accessed at \url{https://github.com/eic/InclusiveEarlyScienceGrids}. Further processing of the events uses Jupyter iPython notebooks, which are also stored in the repository. Samples of the ROOT files produced from the processing of 25.10.0 simulation samples are stored in the repository, as are PineAPPL grids for the beam energy configurations and binning schemes used in this analysis. Detailed running instructions can be found in the github repository, as well as ROOT based plotting scripts to produce the figures shown in this note.
